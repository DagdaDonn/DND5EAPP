# MIMIC

### A Complete D&D 5e Character Creator & Management Tool

MIMIC is a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition app that brings together everything a player needs in one place: races, classes, subclasses, spells, feats, backgrounds, magic items, companions, wild shape, and combat tracking. It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux as a single portable executable, and on Android phones as a touch-first app. It works entirely offline and is free to use.

---

## What's Included

### Core Database
- **85 races** with subraces from every official sourcebook, including modern (MPMM) revisions kept alongside their original printings where the two differ mechanically
- **138 feats** from PHB (2014 & 2024), XGE, TCE, FTD, and more
- **99 backgrounds** from PHB (2014), plus adventure-specific backgrounds — 2024 Origin Feat backgrounds intentionally excluded, since this app targets the 2014 ruleset only
- **14 classes** including Blood Hunter
- **126 subclass combinations** (2014 ruleset) — audited line-by-line against source text, not filled in from memory
- **508 spells** across all 9 levels with per-class spell lists
- **1,283 magic items**, with real mechanical effects (ability score overrides, resistances, weapon bonuses, resource pools, and more) wired for over 99% of the catalog
- **All standard weapons and armor** with computed attack bonuses and damage, plus browsable Silvered and Adamantine variants of every weapon (correctly restricted to melee weapons only for Adamantine, per the real rule) with accurate cost surcharges and the real mechanical text for each
- **28-beast Wild Shape catalog** spanning CR 1/4 through CR 6, filtered by your actual druid level and any race/beast restrictions
- **Full companion stat blocks** for Steel Defender, Wildfire Spirit, Drake Companion, Dancing Item, Primal Companions (Beast of the Land/Sea/Sky), and Eldritch Cannon
- **11 races with real natural weapons** (Aarakocra Talons, Tabaxi Claws, Lizardfolk Bite, Minotaur Horns, Satyr Ram, Longtooth Shifter's Fangs, and more) rendered as actual weapon rows with computed attack and damage — not just flavor text, and correctly covering both original and MPMM printings where a race has both

### Character Builder
- **Full character creation wizard:** Race, Ability Scores, Background & Class, Spells, Equipment
- **Point Buy, Standard Array, or Manual Entry** for ability scores
- **Live race detail panel** — picking a subrace updates the shown ASI and traits immediately, not just at the end
- **Full background details** — feature descriptions, bonus languages, and starting equipment shown in full, not truncated
- **Starting equipment picker** with class-appropriate options — every chosen item lands correctly in your inventory, alongside your background's own equipment and starting gold
- **Level-up wizard** — walks through each level's choices, including nested sub-choices
- **Multiclassing support** — full rules for combining classes

### Spell Management
- **Prepared/known spell tracking**
- **Spell slots by level** — automatically calculated and tracked
- **Concentration tracking** — with save prompts when you take damage
- **Ritual and quick-cast markers**
- **Free daily casts** — spells from your race or a feat (a Tiefling's Hellish Rebuke and Darkness, Fey Touched's Misty Step, Firbolg Magic, Telepathic's Detect Thoughts...) each get a once-per-rest counter, and Cast uses it before a spell slot — so a Fighter can still throw their Hellish Rebuke. Long (or short) rests bring them back
- **Searchable spell browser** — the search box gets the whole row; class and level filters sit behind a funnel button
- **Auto-prepared spells** for domains, oaths, circles, patrons, and sorcerer origins (Aberrant Mind, Clockwork Soul, Lunar Sorcery), each from a verified spell list
- **Spell descriptions on hover**

### Optional Class Features
- **Eldritch Invocations** — all 54 real options, individually wired with real mechanics and correctly gated by level, Pact Boon, and spell prerequisites
- **Battle Master Maneuvers, Metamagic, Fighting Styles, and Artificer Infusions** — every real option audited and wired
- **Elemental Disciplines, Arcane Shot, and Rune Knight Runes** — fully wired as real, usable entries
- **Eldritch Adept, Metamagic Adept, and Martial Adept feats** — grant a real choice of invocation, metamagic, or maneuver
- **Eldritch Versatility** — swap a cantrip, your Pact Boon, or a Mystic Arcanum spell at the right levels

### Combat Tracker
- **Full HP tracking** — Max, Current, and Temporary HP with one-click damage/heal
- **Turn tracker** — Action, Bonus Action, and Reaction economy with one-click New Turn reset
- **Known Actions filter** — every real, usable action, filterable by category and spell level
- **Correct action-economy consumption** — cantrips and leveled spells consume the right slot based on real casting time
- **The real "one leveled spell per turn" rule enforced**, with Haste's genuine extra action recognized as an exception
- **Casting a spell that matches an existing buff/condition system automatically applies it**
- **Class resource tracking** — Rage, Ki, Sorcery Points, Superiority Dice, Channel Divinity, and every other class resource
- **Short and long rest auto-reset**
- **Death saves, condition tracking, and exhaustion**, with real mechanical effects on saves, attack rolls, ability checks, and movement — not just a checkbox
- **Surprised** tracked as a condition (the PHB surprise rule: no moving, acting or reacting until your first turn ends)
- **Weapon and armor equipping** with computed attack bonuses and damage
- **On-hit damage bonuses shown separately by type**, since a different damage type genuinely matters against resistance/immunity

### Resistances, Immunities & Movement
- **Automatic resistance/immunity resolution** from racial traits, subraces, feats, subclass features, and attuned magic items
- **Immunity correctly supersedes resistance** to the same damage type
- **"Resistance to all damage" and "all except X" effects** expand into every individual damage type
- **Player-chosen resistance items** (Ring and Armor of Resistance, Absorbing Tattoo, Orb of Shielding, Wyrmreaver Gauntlets) get a real dropdown to pick which damage type your copy protects against
- **Full movement tracking** — climbing, swimming, and flying speeds from racial traits and class features

### Magic Item Integration
- **1,283 magic items** with full descriptions
- **Attunement tracking** — max 3 attuned items (4 for Artificers at 10th level), and never two copies of the same item (XGtE)
- **Mechanical effects wired for over 99% of the catalog** — resistances, immunities, ability score overrides, AC/save bonuses, weapon and damage bonuses, resource pools, and reminders for effects too situational to automate
- **Searchable magic item browser** with filtering, sorted by rarity (Common → Artifact) and then name — as is your own list
- **Colour means rarity** — dark grey Common, green Uncommon, blue Rare, purple Very Rare, amber Legendary, crimson Artifact, the same on both apps. It's shown as a coloured bar beside the item (or the card's border on Android), never as coloured text, so names stay easy to read
- **Every copy is its own item** — two Manuals of Bodily Health are two books; only magic ammunition stacks, with a quantity
- **Manuals and tomes work once** — studying one raises the score by 2 *and its maximum* by 2 (so a 20 becomes 22, or a Primal Champion's 24 becomes 26), and marks that book "Studied"; it stays in your bag but can't be studied again
- **Spell scrolls carry their spell** — picking a scroll asks which spell is on it, and **Use** casts it with no slot and no material components, at the scroll's own save DC and attack bonus. Following the DMG: a spell not on your class list can't be read (the scroll isn't used up), and one above the level you can cast needs a spellcasting check, DC 10 + its level, or the scroll is lost. Eldritch Knights and Arcane Tricksters read from the wizard list; a Thief's Use Magic Device reads anything

### Gear & Inventory
- **Equipment browser** with search and category filtering
- **Row buttons say what they do** — a magnifying glass for details and a trash can to remove; quantities use − value + boxes, like on Android
- **Inventory grouped by kind** — weapons, armor, magic items, consumables, tools and gear — with equipped items first
- **Items you use get their own icon** — tool kits, musical instruments, tinderboxes and torches, lanterns, thrown flasks, healer's kits
- **Quantity tracking** for stackable items — on Android a stack shows its count as a button beside View; tap it (or press and hold the item) to type a new amount or step it with − / + (hold to go in 5s); 0 removes it
- **Magic potions and scrolls** sit with the consumables, bordered in their rarity colour and sorted by rarity, then name
- **Real tooltips on every item**, both in the reference browser and your owned inventory

### Feat Manager
- **138 feats** from all official sources
- **Automatically checked prerequisites**
- **Feats that grant spells are wired** — Fey Touched, Shadow Touched and Magic Initiate ask which spell you want, and every feat's spells join your spell list
- **One-line feat summaries** in the Features tab, with the full rules text on hover / Show Details instead of repeated in the row
- **DM-granted feats browser** for feats gained outside normal progression

### Interface & Customization
- **26 themes** (16 dark, 10 light) — Obsidian, Dragon's Hoard, Shadowfell, Feywild, Blood Moon, Frostspire, Cinderveil, Tavern Hearth, Mossgrove, Gearworks, Hallowed Stone, Underdark, Astral Sea, Nine Hells, Kraken's Depth, Storm Giant's Eye, Arcane Scroll, Moonlit Vellum, Sunlit Meadow, Elven Grove, Coastal Tide, Rose Chantry, Desert Oasis, Frostlight, Harvest Gold, Sky Citadel
- **Resizable window** with draggable splitters between panels
- **Tabs that fit and join their page** — the selected tab is drawn as part of the page under it, and the tab row never spills off the edge: in a narrower window the names shorten (Abilities, Skills, Gear, Notes), with the full name on hover
- **Choices tab as one scrolling page** — class & level, identity, what was auto-applied, class features by level and every pending choice, each at its full height
- **Right-click any feature, race trait, or subrace trait** for a full detail popup
- **Search everywhere** — find spells, feats, items, and equipment instantly
- **Filters out of the way** — every browser (equipment, magic items, spells, feats, level-up and creation spell picks) is a full-width search box plus a funnel button; the funnel opens a side panel with the filters, shows how many are set, and has a Clear filters button. The same on both apps
- **On Android, one consistent pattern:** the everyday action is a button (Cast, Equip, Drink, Use), the magnifying glass shows details, and press-and-hold opens a small menu for the rarer things — preparing or favouriting a spell, attuning, studying, removing

### Custom Icon Set
- **75 hand-built line icons** replace every emoji the app used to show — tabs, actions, items, rests, conditions, and app chrome
- **One colour, from your theme:** every icon is drawn in the active theme's accent and repaints the moment you switch themes
- **Shared by both apps** — the desktop and Android versions draw the same artwork from one source
- **Condition icons with a little character** — a few of them are nods to famous memes, for anyone who spots them
- **The MIMIC app icon** — the d20 in golden amber, with a proper adaptive icon on Android

### Save & Share
- **Save characters** — to `Documents/MIMIC Characters` on both desktop and Android (change it in Settings); each character's exported sheets go in its own folder there
- **Auto-save** when you create a character, level up or down, or confirm a choice — the same file Save writes
- **Load characters** — pick up where you left off
- **Import from a PDF character sheet** — a character typed into the official 5e character sheet PDF (fillable, or flattened/"printed to PDF") becomes a full character: ability scores (whichever box they were written in), proficiencies and expertise, HP, spells, gear, magic items and money. Anything it can't match is kept word for word on an "Imported from PDF" notes page, along with anything worth checking. Before you pick a file, both apps show what it can and can't do: only the official sheet (not D&D Beyond's or homemade layouts), typed rather than scanned or handwritten, a flattened sheet's tick boxes can't be read, and spells that didn't fit on the sheet aren't there to bring in
- **Export a copy** — a character file to share or back up, a plain-text summary, or a filled-in official PDF character sheet
- **One file format on both apps** — a character saved on your phone opens on your computer, and vice versa

### Dice Roller
- **Built-in dice roller** for any dice combination
- **Quick roll buttons** — d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100
- **Advantage/Disadvantage** — roll twice, take the better or worse result
- **Modifier support and roll history**

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Python 3.9+ and pip.

```bash
pip install PySide6
python run_dnd_creator.py
```

A splash screen appears immediately and animates while the app loads in the background, so startup never looks frozen.

---

## Building a Standalone Executable

### Windows
```bat
installer\windows\build_exe.bat
```

### macOS / Linux
```bash
./installer/windows/build_exe.sh
```

**Output:** `dist/MIMIC.exe` (Windows) or `dist/MIMIC` (macOS/Linux). See [`packaging/windows/BUILD_EXE.md`](packaging/windows/BUILD_EXE.md) for the full guide.

---

## MIMIC on Android

MIMIC also runs as a touch-first Android app (`dnd_app/ui_android/`),
built on the same rules engine and data as the desktop version, so a
character builds, levels and saves identically on both. It has:

- **The full creation wizard** — race, ability scores, background and class, starting equipment
- **The whole character sheet** — abilities, proficiencies, combat, actions, spells, equipment, features, companions, infusions and notes
- **A combat screen** — HP and temp HP, death saves, weapon attack and damage rolls, spell slots with quick casting, conditions, hit dice and Wild Shape
- **A working turn tracker** — Action, Bonus Action and Reaction, used by the Use/Cast buttons as you play
- **Level-up and Choices** — with the Choices tab pulsing while you still have picks to make
- **Rests, a dice roller, themes and settings** — the same 26 themes as desktop
- **Save & Export** — your character list, auto-save, exports to a file, text or PDF, and Import… for a character file or a filled-in PDF character sheet
- **Touch-first controls** — a magnifying glass for details, press-and-hold for the rarer actions, quantity buttons on stacks, and dark-backed dialogs throughout

To build it into an `.apk` you can install on your own phone, see
[`packaging/android/BUILD_APK.md`](packaging/android/BUILD_APK.md) —
a plain-language, numbered walkthrough (install a couple of free
programs once, then run `installer\android\clean_build_android.bat`).

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'PySide6'"
```bash
pip install PySide6
```

### Executable starts but immediately closes
1. Run from a terminal or command prompt to see error output.
2. Delete the `build/` and `dist/` folders and rebuild.
3. Check that `dnd_app/ui_desktop/splash/` and `dnd_app/ui_desktop/icon.ico` exist before building.

### Splash screen looks frozen or doesn't animate
Make sure you're on current source — the heavy startup import runs on a background thread specifically so the splash animation keeps playing while it loads.
