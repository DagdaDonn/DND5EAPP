# ── Racial natural weapons ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Merged in from the former natural_weapons.py — traits that let a
# character make an unarmed strike dealing real weapon-style damage (a
# die plus an ability modifier) instead of the standard 1 bludgeoning.
# Drives a real weapon row in the Combat tab for each one, with a
# computed attack bonus and rollable damage, the same treatment given to
# Monk's Martial Arts and Blood Hunter's Hybrid Transformation.
#
# Each race maps to a LIST of weapon dicts (some races, like Naga, have
# more than one distinct natural attack). Each entry: display name,
# damage die, damage type, and the ability score used for the
# attack/damage roll. An optional note documents a rider effect that
# isn't itself a separate attack (shown as a tooltip rather than
# computed, since it's usually a resource-limited bonus action or an
# on-hit condition).
