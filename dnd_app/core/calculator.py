Calculator module.

For a given character dict, derive every computed stat the sheet
displays: ability modifiers, proficiency bonus, AC, initiative, speed
(walk/fly/swim/climb, including condition and exhaustion locks),
senses, saving throws, skill checks, spell save DC/attack bonus,
resistances/immunities, and class/racial/feat/magic-item resource
pools. Reads only from the character dict and static game data;
individual getter functions are pure, while update_all() writes the
aggregated results back onto the character dict for the UI to render.
