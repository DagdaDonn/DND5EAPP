"""Character choices, shared by both apps.

  * What a character still has to pick -- subclass, feats, race and tool
    choices, optional class features, DM rewards. Each generator takes the
    character and returns a list of choice dicts: id, label, pool, count,
    and what's already been chosen.
  * Cleaning up after a change -- a level down, a removed class, or a new
    race, subrace or background drops the picks that no longer apply,
    and everything that hangs off them.
