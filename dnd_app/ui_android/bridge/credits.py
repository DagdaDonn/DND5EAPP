"""Credits bridge -- Android equivalent of ui_desktop's CreditsDialog
(dnd_app/ui_desktop/pages/main_window.py). Both read the project's root
README.md directly rather than maintaining a separate credits blurb
that would drift out of sync with it -- this file just has its own
path-resolution logic since it lives at a different depth in the repo
than main_window.py does, so the two can't share a single relative-path
constant.
