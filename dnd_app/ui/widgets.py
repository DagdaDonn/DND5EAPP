"""Reusable custom widgets for the character creator.

Only FlowLayout/FlowContainer are actually used anywhere in the app
(imported by sheet.py) — everything else this file used to hold
(SkillRow, StatBox, HPTracker, ClassEntryRow, SpellSlotBar, SpellRow,
FeatureCard [defined twice], FeatureSection, ResourceWidget,
LevelHeader, AbilityWidget, plus their lbl()/hline()/colored_btn()
helpers) was dead code — an earlier widget set superseded by
equivalents built directly into sheet.py/shared.py, never actually
imported from here by anything. Confirmed via a repo-wide grep before
removing it, as part of the styling-standardization pass (see
KNOWN_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md) — styling dead code that never renders
was pointless, and ~600 lines of unreachable classes were exactly the
kind of duplication-inflating clutter that pass was meant to clear
out.
