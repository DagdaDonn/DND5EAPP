# Building MIMIC for Android

This folder turns the app into `dist/MIMIC.apk`, a file you copy to your
phone and tap to install — the Android counterpart of
`packaging\windows\build_exe.bat` making `MIMIC.exe`. The build runs
**buildozer** (a wrapper around
[python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android), "p4a")
inside WSL on Windows. Android needs a fair amount of one-time setup first;
that's Google's build tools, not MIMIC-specific complexity.

These steps match what has worked on a real Windows + WSL machine for this
project. If one doesn't match what you see on yours, adjust as you go — it
doesn't mean you did something wrong.

## What's here

| File | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `clean_build_android.bat` / `.sh` | **The build.** Run it every time you want a new APK |
| `setup_buildozer_spec.bat` / `.sh` | One-time setup: finds the Android SDK/NDK, the wheels and the Qt jars, and writes their paths into `buildozer.spec` |
| `make-android-apk.sh` | Turns the build's `.aab` into an installable APK (the clean build runs it) |
| `p4a_hook.py` | Build hook p4a runs to fix the Qt bootstrap — see [Why `p4a_hook.py` exists](#why-p4a_hookpy-exists) |
| `icon.png`, `icon_background.png`, `icon_foreground.png` | Launcher icons — see [Icon](#icon) |
| `wheels/` | Any Android PySide6/Shiboken6 wheels the setup had to download (not in git -- the repo's own copies are at the repo root) |

The build config itself is `dnd_app/ui_android/buildozer.spec`. It stays
next to the Android app because buildozer keeps its multi-GB build cache,
`.buildozer/`, beside it.

Each `.bat` opens WSL and runs the `.sh` of the same name in an interactive
bash (so `~/.bashrc`'s pyenv setup applies), and the window stays open at
the end. You can also run the `.sh` directly from a WSL terminal.

## First-time setup (do this once)

1. **Install WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), if you don't already
   have it: `wsl --install` from an admin Command Prompt, then restart.
2. **Install Python 3.11 inside WSL.** p4a is pinned to `v2024.01.21` in
   `buildozer.spec` (see [Why this p4a version](#why-this-p4a-version)),
   which targets Python 3.11:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv
   # or: pyenv install 3.11.9 && pyenv global 3.11.9
   ```
3. **Install buildozer and cython for that Python**, inside WSL:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m pip install --user buildozer cython
   ```
4. **Install a JDK (Java)** inside WSL: [Eclipse Temurin 17](https://adoptium.net/)
   (`sudo apt install temurin-17-jdk`, or Adoptium's instructions) — 17 is
   the Qt-recommended version.
5. **Get the Android SDK and NDK.** Easiest: install
   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), open it once,
   then *More Actions / Tools → SDK Manager → SDK Tools* → tick
   **NDK (Side by side)** → *Apply*. p4a `v2024.01.21` recommends NDK 25b;
   a newer one (r28c) has worked too, with a warning.
6. **Run the setup script:**
   ```
   packaging\android\setup_buildozer_spec.bat
   ```
   It finds the SDK/NDK, uses the Android PySide6/Shiboken6 wheels at the
   repo root (or downloads them into `wheels/` if they're missing; they're cross-compiled for
   `android_aarch64` — not the desktop `pip install PySide6`), extracts the
   Qt Android jars from them, and writes `buildozer.spec`'s
   machine-specific lines: `source.dir`, `android.sdk_path`,
   `android.ndk_path`, `p4a.local_recipes`, `p4a.hook`, `android.add_jars`
   and the icon paths. It's safe to re-run any time a path changes, and it
   backs the spec up first. It never touches `p4a.branch`.

That's all. You won't need to repeat it unless you move the repo or
reinstall the SDK/NDK.

## Every time you want a new build

Double-click **`clean_build_android.bat`**. It:

1. stops leftover buildozer/p4a/Gradle/aapt2 processes, clears the old
   outputs and `/tmp/mimic-app-staging`, and resets the generated
   `PythonActivity.java` so `p4a_hook.py` patches it from scratch
2. dry-runs the hook's Java patch, so a mistake fails in seconds rather
   than 20 minutes in
3. stages the repo-root `main.py`, `README.md` (the Credits screen shows it)
   and `dnd_app/` — without `ui_desktop/`, which the Android app doesn't
   use: it shares only `core/` and `data/` with the desktop app
4. runs `buildozer android release` (log in `/tmp/mimic-build-*.log`)
5. turns the AAB into **`dist/MIMIC.apk`**, replacing the last build, with
   bundletool (downloaded once to `~/.cache/mimic/`) and your debug key

It keeps the expensive compiled parts, so it is not a full rebuild.

**The first build is slow** — p4a downloads and compiles a whole Python
distribution (CPython, OpenSSL, sqlite, libffi, the Qt bootstrap); 20–40
minutes isn't unusual. After that, builds reuse the cache in
`dnd_app/ui_android/.buildozer/` and take a couple of minutes when only
`.py`/`.qml` files changed. Touching `p4a_hook.py` or a recipe makes the
next one slow again.

Then **copy `dist\MIMIC.apk` to your phone** (Google Drive, email, USB —
any way you'd move a file) and tap it to install. Your phone warns about
installing from an unknown source the first time; allow it for this file.
With `adb` and a connected phone, `adb install -r dist/MIMIC.apk` works too.

## How the build works

### The tool

There's no PyInstaller for Android, so Windows and Android use different
packaging tools, not just different config files. PySide6 does ship
`pyside6-android-deploy`, which wraps the same buildozer/p4a machinery, but
this project doesn't use it: on `/mnt/c/` paths it writes `buildozer.spec`,
fails to find the file it just wrote, and silently falls back to a stock
Kivy/SDL2 template — the APKs it made crashed on launch. The hand-written
`dnd_app/ui_android/buildozer.spec` is the one real config, used directly.

### `buildozer.spec` fields worth knowing

The setup script only changes the path lines. The rest, if you ever edit
the spec by hand:

- **`p4a.branch = v2024.01.21`** — load-bearing, see
  [Why this p4a version](#why-this-p4a-version). Never remove it.
- **`p4a.bootstrap = qt`** — the Qt bootstrap, not Kivy's default SDL2
  one. Missing this is exactly what broke the `pyside6-android-deploy`
  APKs.
- **`p4a.hook`** — points at `packaging/android/p4a_hook.py`. The clean
  build checks it does, and stops with a message if not (run the setup
  again).
- **`android.add_jars`** — the Qt Android jars (`Qt6Android.jar`,
  `Qt6AndroidBindings.jar`, `Qt6AndroidQuick.jar`), each listed once.
  Missing the first two fails the Java compile ("package ... does not
  exist"); missing `Qt6AndroidQuick.jar` fails only at runtime —
  `libQt6Quick`'s `JNI_OnLoad` registers natives against
  `org.qtproject.qt.android.QtQuickView`, which lives in that jar, so it
  returns `JNI_ERR` and QtLoader aborts. A duplicate entry breaks Gradle's
  classpath.
- **`android.apptheme`** — must NOT be quoted
  (`android.apptheme = @android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar`). Quotes produce
  invalid manifest XML and fail Gradle at `processDebugMainManifest`.
- **`source.include_patterns`** and **`p4a.extra_args`'s
  `--private=/tmp/mimic-app-staging`** — p4a packages the staging folder
  the clean build fills (step 3 above), rather than trusting buildozer's
  own file globbing to assemble the right tree.
- **`android.qt_libs` / `p4a.extra_args`** — which Qt modules get bundled
  (`Quick,Core,Qml,Gui,QuickControls2,OpenGL,Network`), plus
  `--load-local-libs=plugins_platforms_qtforandroid` (the Qt Android
  platform plugin) and `--icon=` (must match `android.icon`). They all
  need to agree.
- **`p4a.local_recipes`** — `deployment/recipes/` on your machine (not in
  git): the PySide6/Shiboken6 recipes that unpack the wheels instead of
  compiling them, and a hand-patched `python3` recipe. That one isn't
  regenerable, so commit it (see the note in `.gitignore`). Each wheel
  recipe names its wheel by full path (`wheel_path`); if that file has
  gone, the clean build points the recipe at the same wheel in the repo
  root or `wheels/`.
- **`version`** — the app's one version number. The Windows EXE reads it
  from here too, so both always match.
- **Package name (`package.domain` + `package.name`)** — changing it
  makes Android treat it as a different app (no update path for existing
  installs).
- **`android.archs`** — `arm64-v8a` alone covers almost every real
  device. Each extra ABI roughly multiplies the bundled Qt/Python size.
- **`android.api` / `android.minapi`** — target whatever's current for
  Play Store submission when you build; that moves roughly yearly.

### Why this p4a version

`buildozer.spec` pins `p4a.branch = v2024.01.21`. p4a's `master` branch
(as of `2026.05.09`) targets Python 3.14, and its `python3` recipe still
carries patches written for 3.7–3.11 that fail to apply on 3.14 — the
build breaks before it compiles anything. `v2024.01.21` targets Python
3.11.5, where they apply cleanly. **Never remove or change
`p4a.branch`**: buildozer re-clones p4a from whatever branch the spec
names on every run, so without the pin it silently resets to `master`.

### Why `p4a_hook.py` exists

p4a runs this hook at two points in the build, and it fixes separate,
otherwise fatal problems with p4a `v2024.01.21`'s Qt bootstrap:

- **`before_apk_build`** copies `libc++_shared.so` from the NDK into the
  dist's `libs/arm64-v8a/` (and removes a stale copy under
  `src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`) — without it Qt refuses to load and the
  app crashes on launch even though the *build* succeeded, which is easy
  to misread as an app bug. It also flattens every native `.so` the
  PySide6/Shiboken6 bundle needs — `libQt6*.so`, Qt's plugins, every QML
  module's plugin, and the top-level `Qt*.abi3.so`/`Shiboken.abi3.so` —
  into `libs/arm64-v8a/`. That last part is counterintuitive: Qt 6.11's
  Android bootstrap calls `System.loadLibrary("QtQuick")` etc. during
  `onCreate`, so Android's loader has to find those `.abi3.so` files as
  native libraries, not just importable Python modules.
- **`before_apk_assemble`** patches the generated `PythonActivity.java`
  three ways: replaces `QtNative.setEnvironmentVariable(...)` with
  `android.system.Os.setenv(...)` (Qt 6.11 removed the former, but the
  template still calls it — the Java compile fails without this); strips a
  stale reflective `QtNative.startApplication(...)` call left by an
  earlier, wrong attempt at the same fix; and **prepends a
  `System.loadLibrary(...)` loop for the whole Qt Quick chain, in
  dependency order** (`Qt6Core` first, `Qt6Quick` last) to
  `PythonActivity.onCreate`. Without that, Android loads `libQt6Quick`
  first, `Qt6Core`'s `JNI_OnLoad` (which caches the `JavaVM*` that
  `QJniEnvironment::getJniEnv()` needs) hasn't run yet, and the app
  segfaults at `fault addr 0x0`. Loading everything up front, in order,
  means every `JNI_OnLoad` runs with the JVM already cached.
- It also installs the **adaptive icon** — see [Icon](#icon).

A dist regenerated from scratch also needs **`lib2to3/tests/*` in its
`blacklist.txt`** (it lives inside the generated dist, not this repo), or
`compileall` can die compiling the Python 2 test fixtures CPython ships.

Don't change or delete `p4a_hook.py` without testing a full rebuild
afterwards — each hook point runs late, so a mistake only shows up after
the slow path.

### Permissions

Saves go to the shared Documents/MIMIC Characters folder (or a folder
picked in Settings, inside Documents or Download), falling back to the
app's private folder if shared storage can't be written. Sharing a
character goes through the system pickers — **Import…** reads a file from
anywhere, **Save elsewhere…** writes one wherever you choose — which need
no storage permission.

### Icon

`icon.png` is the launcher icon for launchers before Android 8: the amber
d20 on the app's dark background, full-bleed so nothing is padded white.
Android 8+ uses an **adaptive icon** made of two 432 px layers:
`icon_background.png` (the dark backdrop) and `icon_foreground.png` (the
die, inside the 66 dp safe zone so every launcher mask shows all of it).
`p4a_hook.py` copies both into the build and writes
`res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/icon.xml` (p4a's own `--icon-fg/--icon-bg` would
target that folder too, but the Qt bootstrap doesn't have it). Without it,
Android shrinks `icon.png` and pads it with white.

## Good to know

- Don't run `buildozer android clean` or delete
  `dnd_app/ui_android/.buildozer/` — that cache is what keeps builds to a
  couple of minutes instead of 30–50.
- If a build is interrupted (Ctrl+C) while extracting or configuring a
  component, the next run can find it half-extracted and fail
  confusingly. Deleting just that component's folder under
  `dnd_app/ui_android/.buildozer/android/platform/build-*/build/other_builds/`
  is usually enough — no need to wipe the whole cache.
- Installing a new APK over the old one (or `adb install -r`) keeps the
  app's data; don't uninstall between builds unless the package name or
  signing key changed.

## Signing

The APK is signed with your PC's **debug key**
(`~/.android/debug.keystore`; the clean build creates it if it's
missing). Android only installs an update signed with the same key as the
installed app, so **back that file up** — a new PC with a new key means
uninstalling and reinstalling (your saves survive; they're in Documents).

For a release (sharing the app widely, or the Play Store), make a proper
key once and keep it safe — treat it like a password, never commit it:

1. `keytool -genkey -v -keystore mimic-release.keystore -alias mimic -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
2. Point the build at it (buildozer's keystore settings — check
   `buildozer android release --help` for your version), or sign the APK
   afterwards with `apksigner`.

Switching keys is easiest before 1.0: everyone on the old key reinstalls
once, and nobody has to again.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| The clean build stops with "buildozer.spec source.dir is ... but this script lives in ..." | The spec has another checkout's paths — run `setup_buildozer_spec.bat` |
| The clean build stops with "buildozer.spec p4a.hook is ..." | The spec still points at the hook's old place — run `setup_buildozer_spec.bat` once |
| `git clone -b 'master', ...` in the log even though the spec sets `p4a.branch` | The spec's `p4a.branch` line got removed, or the local p4a checkout's remembered branch drifted — check `dnd_app/ui_android/buildozer.spec` |
| A patch fails to apply deep inside the `python3` recipe | You're on p4a `master` (Python 3.14), not the pinned `v2024.01.21` — see [Why this p4a version](#why-this-p4a-version) |
| `sh.CommandNotFound: .../python3/config.guess` | A half-extracted Python source tree from an interrupted build — delete `other_builds/python3/` under `dnd_app/ui_android/.buildozer/.../build/` |
| "ANDROID_SDK_ROOT is not set" / NDK not found | Re-run `setup_buildozer_spec.bat` — it writes the paths into the spec rather than relying on environment variables |
| Build succeeds but the app crashes instantly on launch | `p4a_hook.py`'s `before_apk_build` step (bundling `libc++_shared.so`) didn't run |
| Java compile fails on `QtNative.setEnvironmentVariable` / "cannot find symbol" | `p4a_hook.py`'s `before_apk_assemble` patch didn't run |
| `SIGSEGV` at `fault addr 0x0` on `qtMainLoopThrea`; the tombstone shows `QJniEnvironment::getJniEnv()` → `libQt6Quick*.so`'s `JNI_OnLoad` | Another Qt library's `JNI_OnLoad` ran before `Qt6Core`'s — the load-order part of [Why `p4a_hook.py` exists](#why-p4a_hookpy-exists) |
| Gradle fails at `processDebugMainManifest` | `android.apptheme`'s value is quoted — it must not be |
| Java compile fails with "package org.qtproject.qt.android.bindings does not exist" | `android.add_jars` is missing, wrong, or lists a jar twice |
| `libQt6Quick_arm64-v8a.so` fails with `JNI_ERR returned from JNI_OnLoad` (runtime only) | `android.add_jars` is missing `Qt6AndroidQuick.jar` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` for `dnd_app...` on the phone | The staging folder (`/tmp/mimic-app-staging`) is missing that module — check step 3 of the clean build's output |
| `compileall` fails under `lib2to3/tests/` | Add `lib2to3/tests/*` to the dist's `blacklist.txt` |
| Black screen, no crash; logcat shows `dlopen failed: library "org.kivy.android.PythonActivity" not found` | `QtNative.startApplication(params, mainLib)` got its arguments swapped, so Python never started. `p4a_hook.py` passes `("", <nativeLibraryDir>/libmain_arm64-v8a.so)`, migrates the old call in an already-patched dist, and fails the build if the old call survives |
| `:mergeReleaseResources` fails with `AAPT2 ... Daemon startup failed` | Environment, not code — usually transient on WSL from a `/mnt/c/` path. Retry; if it persists, run `./gradlew --stop` in the dist directory first |
